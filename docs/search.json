    "text": "Task 1: Conceptual Questions\n\nThe purpose of the lapply() function is to apply a function to a list, and return a list. The equivalent in the purrr package is the map() function.\nlapply(X = my_list, FUN = cor, method = \"kendall\")\n\n\nmethod = \"kendall\" needs to be after defining FUN = cor, not within cor()\n\n\nTwo advantages of using the purrr package over base R are the helper functions included in purr and the general consistency it has.\nA side-effect function is a function does not automatically return a modified version of the data. Examples include print() and plot().\nYou can create a variable called sd within a function and not have it overwrite sd() from base R because R creates a separate environment for your functions, with the objects created within thr function only existing while the function is being run.\n\n\n\nTask 2 : Writing R Functions"
